# **Easy UI calculator on Java**
This code represents a simple calculator program that operates with a graphical interface. It allows users to input numbers, perform basic mathematical operations, and view the results on the screen.
The main idea behind the program is that the user enters a number using buttons on the screen. When the user selects a mathematical operation, like addition, subtraction, or multiplication, the calculator remembers the current number and the chosen operation. Then, when the next number is entered and the user presses “equals,” the program performs the necessary calculation between the first and second numbers.

The program also takes care of several details, such as:
+ Handling decimal numbers. The program won’t allow the user to enter two decimal points in one number.
+ Percentage operations, which allow users to calculate a percentage of a number.
